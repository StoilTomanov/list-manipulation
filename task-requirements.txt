// requirements sent over the email with HR
1. Create a pre-defined list with text/number values, it could a json or just a variable - For example: Apple, Orange, Pineapple
2. Create two equal blocks that will render a list of these values
3. Each block should be independent, actions made on a block shouldn't affect the lists of the other block
4. Each block should contain:
  - An option to add a new item
  - An option to remove the last item
5. All interactions with a list should be done in the service, this means the component should only
   get the list value passed in, and all data manipulation should be done inside the service
6. Make sure to use immutable arrays
7. Make sure to use Observables
8. Add a basic styling, make it pretty ;)
9. Feel free to use MaterialUI (+)
10. It will be a plus to have unit tests, even if basic
11. Push this into a pubic Github repository and provide its URL
